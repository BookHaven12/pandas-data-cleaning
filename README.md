# School Data Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes school data to explore metrics across two school types: **Charter** and **Public (District)** schools.  This analysis aims to identify factors that contribute to higher passing rates, and ultimately student success. 

## Tools & Skills Used
Languages: Python, Pandas
Techniques: Data cleaning, grouping/aggregation, basic statistics
Libraries: Pandas
Environment: Jupyter Notebook

## Key Findings

1.  **Performance by School Type:**
**Charter schools** had a significantly higher overall passing rate **(90%)** compared to **Public schools (53%)**. 

2.  **Impact of School Size:**
Schools with fewer than 2,000 students performed better than larger schools (2,000-5,000 students).
The small and medium sized schools had an overall passing rate of 90%, while the larger schools had only a 58% passing rate.
The area that seemed to be affected the most by school size was the % passing math which was only 69% in the large schools, compared to 93% in the medium to small schools.
Reading seemed to be similar in the medium and smaller schools, and only slighly lower in the larger schools.

3.  **Spending Per Student:**
Charter schools were able to achieve better scores in both reading and math while spending less per student (<$630).
Public schools had the lowest scores across the board despite spending the most on their students ($630-$680).
Charter schools spending less than $585 per student had the highest scores and passing rates in all 3 areas!

## Conclusion
The analysis of the data clearly shows that **school size** and **school type** have the biggest impact on a student's overall success.  
This conclusion is further supported in the fact that the **Charter schools with less than 2,000 students rank as the top 8 schools**.
Public schools have more funding availble per student, but their larger sizes negatively impact students' overall success rate.
