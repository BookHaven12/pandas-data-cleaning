# School Data Analysis

## Overview  
This project analyzes academic performance metrics across Charter and Public (District) schools to identify key factors contributing to student success, such as school type, size, and per-student spending.

## Tools & Skills Used
- **Languages & Libraries:** Python, Pandas
- **Techniques:** Data cleaning, grouping & aggregation, basic statistics, comparative analysis
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## Key Findings

### 1. Performance by School Type  
- Charter schools outperformed Public schools significantly, with an overall passing rate of **90% vs. 53%**.

### 2. Impact of School Size  
- Schools with fewer than **2,000 students** had better academic outcomes:
  - Overall passing rate: **90%** (small/medium) vs. **58%** (large)
  - Math passing rate: **93%** in small/medium schools vs. **69%** in large schools
  - Reading scores were more consistent, with only a slight drop in larger schools

### 3. Spending Per Student  
- Charter schools spending **less than $630 per student** achieved higher reading and math scores
- Public schools spent more ($630â€“$680) but had lower overall performance
- Schools spending **under $585 per student** had the highest passing rates in all subjects

## Conclusion  
Charter schools with smaller student populations consistently outperformed larger public schools, even with lower per-student spending. The data suggests that **school type and size** have a greater impact on student success than funding alone.
